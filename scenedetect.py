#         PySceneDetect: Python-Based Video Scene Detector
#    -----------------------------------------------------------
#        [ http://www.bcastell.com/projects/pyscenedetect/ ]
#        [ https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/  ]
#
# This program implements an optimized threshold-based scene detection
# algorithm, generating a list of scene/chapter timecodes (or frame)
# numbers), which can be used to split the video with an external tool
# (e.g. ffmpeg, mkvmerge) into sequential parts.  Usage:
#
#   ./scenedetect.py [-h] -i VIDEO_FILE [optional args]
#
# Where -i denotes the input video, and -h shows the help message (as
# well as a list of optional arguments and descriptions).

#
# Three types of 'cuts':  Scene CUT, IN, OUT
#  -> technically only need CUT/IN, but what about fade bias?
#  -> thus have each detector return a CUT, FADE_IN, or FADE_OUT
#  -> allow fade bias to have 3 values - 'in', 'out', 'mid'
#     so say fade out at 1s, fade in at 2s:
#       for in, scene starts at @ 1s;  1.5s for mid;  2s for out
#
#  Logic for each case for FADES:
#    -> start above threshold, Scene 1 starts at 0s (video_start)
#    -> start below threshold, Scene 0 at 0s, Scene 1, bias between 0s and fade_in
#    -> end below threshold, Scene N+1, bias new scene between fade_out and video_end
#    -> end above threshold, Scene N
#
#  When reading from the statsfile:
#    -> read only, but if needs updating, need to generate new statsfile
#    -> make new with .new on end, rename & delete old when done
#    -> keep frame metrics in memory for all frames incase of discrepency?
#       or just recompute and restore the statsfile each time (to check for accuracy)?
