""" PySceneDetect Unit Test Suite

To run all available tests run `python -m unittest discover -v` from the parent
directory (i.e. the root project folder of PySceneDetect containing the
scenedetect/ and tests/ folders).  This will automatically find and run all
of the test cases in the tests/ folder and display the results.
